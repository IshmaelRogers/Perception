# Object Recognition

Object recognition is a very important concept in computer vision and robotics. We can equip robots with sensors so that they may be able to perceive the world around them. It is our job to provide them with the ability to recoginize objects based on previous data. 

The problem we need to solve is, how can we give the robot the abilty to recognize an object in a scene regardless of its postion and orientation?
The solution is to identify the features that best describe the object we are looking for.
NOTE: The better our description of the object we are looking for, the more likely our algorithm is able to find it. 

# Features

Features are the defining characteristics of an object that help tell it apart from other objects. For our perception algorithm is is just as importatn to identify features we not interested in as well. Once we have an explictly defined set of feeatures, we can train a classifier to recognize the object of interest from the point cloud data. 

What makes a good set of features?
---
A good combination of color and shape data will differnetiate the object of interest from other objects in the scene.
